# Morphological Filters

A Python implementation of simple morphological filters in one dimension.

## Overview

This library provides implementations of fundamental morphological operations:

- **Baseline** - Compute baseline of a signal
- **Dilation** - Morphological dilation operation
- **Erosion** - Morphological erosion operation
- **Opening** - Morphological opening (erosion followed by dilation)
- **Closing** - Morphological closing (dilation followed by erosion)

## Reference

This code is based on the following unpublished work:

> Holmes, W. Harvey. (2020, May 18). *Simple Morphological Filters in One Dimension* [Unpublished manuscript].
